                    Wishlist is an app that allows users to record restaurants they want to visit. Plugging into the Google Maps and Google Places APIs, the app automatically stores a restaurant's crucial information like location and hours, while also allowing the user to add their own notes based on friend's recommendations or their own personal experiences. Never again forget the name of that great spot your friend said you have to try!

                After being exposed to programming while an undergrad at Stanford, I took a wandering path on the Professional Squash Association World Tour. After becoming one of the top 5 ranked Americans on the Tour, I retired in July 2017 and began to explore life off the squash court. I found my way to coding, because I liked the idea of being able to take a project all the way from conception to reality. I continue to embrace each day as an opportunity to develop my skills and am interested in joining a team that embraces a growth mindset in everything they do. When I'm not coding or on a squash court, I love being outdoors, whether it's hiking in the Sierras, playing in Golden Gate Park, or biking through the Marin Headlands.
